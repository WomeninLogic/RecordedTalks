# Valeria de Paiva Recorded Talks

A place to keep info about talks I have given.

<br>

This updates the webpage in https://vcvpaiva.github.io/RecordedTalks/ when it works.

## Contributing


```
{"title": "Title of the talk",
"talk_link": "Link to the Youtube video",
"author": "Author’s name",
"date": "Date of recording the talk",
"author_image": "Name of image as you have named it in the img/ folder",
"author_link": "Link to author’s website",
"description": "Description of the talk."}
```

Add author’s image to the `img/` folder and make sure to link to the image under the `author_image` key of the database with the the exact name as you have given in the `img/` folder. Also, make sure that each of the entries you add are separated by a comma in the appropriate JSON format. You can ensure the data you have entered is in the correct format by validating the JSON file by copy pasting it in one of the JSON services like [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com)
